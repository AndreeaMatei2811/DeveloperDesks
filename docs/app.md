# Developers' Desks

Elevator pitch: developers are social creatures first and foremost, and want to share pictures of their natural habitats with each other. Using this app, developers can share pictures of their desks, like and comment on other people's desks, and even annotate and add fun post-it notes to them.

- Main view: a stream of photos of developer desks
- Search by: developer name, items (tags?)
- Filter views: (default) newest, trending/popularity, near me

Possible enhancements:

- geolocating pictures, and searching by map / location
