# Setup information

## Expo

This project was bootstrapped with the Expo CLI, [like this](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

ðŸŽ“ _Expo is a service that allows you to get started easily on a React Native app, without having to install the "software development kits" for Android and/or iOS. (You'd need to have a Macbook to even setup the iOS SDK.) Instead of building the full native project directly on your computer, only your JavaScript code is bundled, and you can then "preview" your app through the Expo playground app. If you get more serious about your native app development, you will want to download the SDKs instead and forget about Expo, because this gives you more flexibility and control. It will also allow better integration with native APIs in the long run, through native libraries that aren't supported using Expo._

You'll have to download the Expo playground app first, either for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) or for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779), whichever phone you have. If you don't have a smartphone, you can use also [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io/), an online web playground. This will not work as well, so we don't recommend it.
